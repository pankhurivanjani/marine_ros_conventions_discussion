# Marine ROS conventions discussion repository
This repository has been created to discuss about new ROS messages, tools, and safety guidelines for the maritime domain. 
Once we agree with the messages defined here, they will be added to an already existing ROS package (e.g., *sensor_msgs*, *nav_msgs*, ...) or in a new messages package.
